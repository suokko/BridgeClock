What is it?
-----------

The BridgeClock is a simple application to show time information and online
results in a contract bridge tournament. It probably could be used for other
games where playing time is limited by short rounds. But user interface is
designed for bridge.

The Latest Version
------------------

Because BridgeClock is an open source project you can find the latest source
code from https://github.com/suokko/BridgeClock. The latest release binaries are
available from https://googledrive.com/host/0B4izKEmfNQIBajhOOGZqR2JmNXM.

Documentation
-------------

So far this README is all documentation. That makes any good documentation very
welcome contribution.

Installation
------------

* Windows

Binary installation can be done using BridgeClock.msi found from
https://googledrive.com/host/0B4izKEmfNQIBajhOOGZqR2JmNXM. The installer will
copy all program files to your program files directory and setup desktop and
start menu shortcuts.

* Linux

BridgeClock-linux-<version>.tar.gz can be extracted to any directory. The
package provides all required files to run the software on most common Linux
distributions. The BridgeClock binary needs to be run from extraction directory
so it can find all required files.

* From sources

Qt (http://qt-project.org/) is only dependency for BridgeClock. But code is
written to use the latest qml features provided in Qt 5.2 or later. Qt 5.2.2 or
later is recomended because there is an crash issue in Qt 5.2.0 and 5.2.1 that is
fixed in 5.2.2.

  # Fetch the sources
  git clone https://github.com/suokko/BridgeClock.git
  cd BridgeClock
  # Setup makefiles from qt project
  qmake
  # Compile sources 
  make
  # Generate runtime translation files
  make release
  # Run the BridgeClock
  ./BridgeClock

BridgeClock.pro project file is still missing installation rules which makes it
tricky to install self compiled version to the system. Binary packaging code is
included in wix subdirectory. But that requires windows cross compilation
environment and chroot for linux binaries.

Licensing
---------

Please see the file called LICENSE. Also LICENSE.QT.LGPL includes terms Qt
binary distribution.

Bug reports
-----------

If you find issues or need a new feature they can be reported to
https://github.com/suokko/BridgeClock/issues. Good reports are more likely to be
addressed faster.

* Good reports

Good reports include detailed step to reproduce the issue. If that isn't
possible then some screen capture and detailed explanation what happened will
help understand what is the issue. Without picture it is very common that
developer and user would be talking about different matter.

Contributing changes
--------------------

The project is open source so you are free to make any changes you wish. If you
want to contribute your changes back to project preferred method is a github pull
request (https://github.com/suokko/BridgeClock/pulls).

To make pull request you need:
- Have your changes committed to your local git repository
- Create a fork of BridgeClock in github
- Push your changes to the fork
- Make a pull request using github website

Translations
------------

Translations are stored in xml files but there is no need to modify those files
directly. Translations can be done using Weblate web interface that knows how to
write correct xml files.

* Translations using Weblate

Detailed documentation for Weblate can be found from the Weblate project page.
http://weblate.org/

The translation interface van be found from
https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/bridgeclock/master/

First step is to create a Weblate account. The information that you provide
during registration will be used to credit your translations changes.

With the new account translation process can begin. First step from the project
view is to select the language you want to translate. The language link leads to
the language specific information page. There is links to different groups of
items under the "Strings to check" header.

Select a translation group like "untranslated strings" leads to actual
translation interface. Each string has its own page with next and back buttons
in top for browsing between strings.

Source: An English text that is used if no translation is provided for the language.
Context: Context is used to group translations based on file the appear or using
	key provided by programmer.
Translation: The text box for translated string that will be shown.
Fuzzy: The checkbox is automatically selected if English source has changed
	slightly after translation. It indicates that translation needs to be
	checked if it still has same meaning. After check and possible fix 
	the checkbox should be cleared to let other know that check was done.
Comment: Extra information trying to help select correct word from alternatives
	with similar meaning.
Used in: Links to source code files where this translation is used.

* Testing your translation changes

Too bad there isn't any simple way to test translations. Only possible way
currently is to compile the application from sources. See Instalation from
sources for details.

* Adding a new language

If your language isn't yet listed as possible translation you can request
addition using https://github.com/suokko/BridgeClock/issues. A new language is
simple to add so any request wil lhave high priority.
